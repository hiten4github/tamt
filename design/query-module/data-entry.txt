Query Module Design: Traffic flow data entry

The Road tags must be those already in the system (including the default zone tags).

There will be multiple lines of capture with data for different time of day on 
each Tag and for multiple days. 

Usually vehicle flow counts are conducted over a one week  to three week period 
(depending on the accuracy required) and hourly from say 5:00 AM to 10:00 pm.

Whilst we probably do need a screen for data entry, it would also be most 
useful to allow this same data to be captured in Excel (or Open Office) and 
imported from say a csv file. This would be far quicker for the user, 
since he can use copy/paste from the field documents.
