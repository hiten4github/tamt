Query Module Design: Traffic flow data entry
============================================

(Taken from http://tamt.googlecode.com/files/tamt-query-uisketch-response-001.pdf)

From this*, the equivalent number of vehicles per hour can be calculated (if the 
traffic count is over 15 mins, then the number of vehicles counted would be 
multiplied by 60/15 to get the hourly figure. The day type would need to be 
stored (eg 1=Weekday, 2=Saturday, 3=Sunday and holidays) and hour (eg 0:00 to 
0:59:59=0, 1:00 to 1:59:59=1) so that average can be calculated.
